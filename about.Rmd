### About
Hello! My name is Victoria Mello, and I am a recent graduate of Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, where I earned my Master of Public Health in Sociomedical Sciences, along with a certificate in research methods, in May 2024. My academic and professional pursuits center on utilizing mixed-methods approaches to thoroughly analyze and, most importantly, address complex public health issues. Driven by a profound commitment to promoting equity, I am particularly passionate about advocating for programs and policies that foster social, economic, and environmental equity as essential pathways to eliminating the deep health disparities prevalent in the US. 
This website includes information such as my [resume](resume.html) as well as some examples of spatial analyses I have created in [QGIS](QGIS.html). This website along with my [final project](https://nn2477.github.io/p8105-fp-rats.github.io/index.html) NYC rat analysis website were created using RStudio. Examples of some interactive data visualizations I made using plotly can be found on my [dashboard](dashboard.html) as well. Below you will find a graduation photo of me from my time in undergrad at Brown University, where I earned my B.A. in Public Health with honors distinction. Please feel free to read my [undergrad thesis](VMthesis.pdf) that I wrote to graduate with honors in my program. I hope you enjoy exploring my personal website!
