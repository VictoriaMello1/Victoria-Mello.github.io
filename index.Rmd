### About
Hello! My name is Victoria Mello, and I am a recent graduate of Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, where I earned my Master of Public Health in Sociomedical Sciences, along with a certificate in research methods, in May 2024. My academic and professional pursuits center on utilizing mixed-methods approaches to thoroughly analyze and, most importantly, address complex public health issues. Driven by a commitment to work collectively toward eliminating deeply rooted health disparities, I am particularly passionate about programs and policies that foster social, economic, and environmental equity as essential pathways to achieving true justice.
This website includes information such as my [resume](resume.html) as well as some examples of spatial analyses I have created using [QGIS](QGIS.html). This website, along with my [final project](https://nn2477.github.io/p8105-fp-rats.github.io/index.html) NYC rat analysis website, were created using RStudio as assignments for a course I took during my MPH program. Some examples of basic interactive data visualizations created with plotly can be found on my [dashboard](dashboard.html) as well. I hope you enjoy exploring my personal website :)
