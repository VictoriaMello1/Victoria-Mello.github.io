# About
My name is Victoria Mello, and I am a Masters in Public Health student in the Sociomedical Sciences department at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health studying research methods and applications. This website includes my [resume](resume.html) as well as some examples of spatial analyses I have created in [QGIS](QGIS.html). This website was created using RStudio and some examples of interactive data visualizations I made using plotly which can be found on my [dashboard](dashboard.html)!
