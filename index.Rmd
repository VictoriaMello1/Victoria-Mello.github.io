### About
Hello! My name is Victoria Mello, and I am a recent graduate of Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, where I earned my Master of Public Health in Sociomedical Sciences with a certificate in research methods, in May 2024. My academic and professional pursuits center on utilizing mixed-methods approaches to thoroughly analyze and, most importantly, address complex public health issues. Driven by a commitment to work collectively toward eliminating deeply rooted health disparities, I am particularly passionate about programs and policies that center social, economic, and environmental justice as essential pathways to achieving true health equity.

This website includes various information about me such as my [resume](resume.html) as well as some examples of spatial analyses I have created using [QGIS](QGIS.html). This website, along with my [final project](https://nn2477.github.io/p8105-fp-rats.github.io/index.html) NYC rat analysis website, were created using RStudio and GitHub for assignments in a 'Data Science' course I took during my masters program. Some examples of basic interactive data visualizations I created with plotly can be found on my [dashboard](dashboard.html) as well. Now sit back, relax, and please enjoy exploring my personal website!
